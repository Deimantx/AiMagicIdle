ðŸ’¡ Design Tips for Cursor AI
Keep all interfaces text-based (labels, buttons, and text popups).

Use Timers for attack delays, skill cooldowns, and crafting time.

Use Signals to update the UI after battle or crafting completes.

Use Nodes like Label, Button, Timer, and VBoxContainer for UI.

Use a main scene with simple navigation buttons at the bottom (Combat, Inventory, Shop, etc.).

Store player data (gold, health, inventory) in a singleton/autoload.
